#### What is a class?

I think of this as a group of specific things with similar attributes and behaviors.  In the case of a program with multiple "users", I would want to create a User class because I would want all of them to have a certain list of attributes which they had in common and to be able to access a pre-defined set of user behaviors.

#### What is a model?

A model is a class that accesses a database.  In the case above, if the User class stored user information in a database outside of Ruby, it would be a model.

#### What is a method?

In the case of the User class above.  A method would be a behavior that a user would want to do.  This could be to add/update/see/delete data from their account.  Or it could be to perform a certain calculation, like getting the total of bank deposits.

#### What is a variable?

A variable is a quantity or entity stored in Ruby memory.  It could be a local variable, as in the case of a variable used by a certain method within a class, it could be an attribute, a variable used within a certain class for a specific object of a class, or it could be a global variable defined to be used across the entire program. 

#### What is a request?

When you click on something in the browser window on a web page, it performs a request.  It in essence asks what it should do next.

#### What is a route?

The route is the path the request from the browser takes to access elements within your program.

#### In the context of a web application, what is a "response"?

The response is the "stuff" sent back to the browser by your program when a request is submitted.
